# Biometric-Kit
An IoT project using an ESP32-DevkitC-v4 and several modules, such as: PN532 (NFC Reader) and AS608 (Fingerprint Reader).
The objectives of this project are:


To retrieve the UID value from NFC cards


To capture raw images of fingerprints


To use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to transmit the data wirelessly
